### Another old project from years back

A few years back, I got really into Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn.

It has groups called Free Companies, which you may know from other games as Guilds, large groups of people.

Wanting to store funny conversations, I made this PHP thing to store them in a database.

It didn't really get used but it was probably a good learning experience at the time.

I say that but I've forgotten a lot of things about PHP!

### What does it require?

A MySQL database pretty much. I guess also an Apache server if you don't have somewhere to host it online.

### Issues?

For some reason, I didn't do the usual thing of sorting the connection details in a conn.php file which is weird because I always used to do that.

Also, why aren't there header.php and footer.php files? Beats me, I should have known about that stuff back then *shrug*
